[![Python Version](http://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.7-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/)

# tdl-warmup-python


## 1. Requirements

- `Python 3.7` (note: support for `Python 2.x` has been dropped)
- `pip` (ensure it supports `Python 3.7`)


## 2. How to start

currently trying to figure out why the package installation does not play nice with me.
module 'backward' is having a stroke.
ah, resolved it I think. versioning issue.

- Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Open `lib/send_command_to_server.py`
- Read the comments as documentation, they will guide through the rest of the setup
